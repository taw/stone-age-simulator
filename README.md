New idea:

* setting is a low-level fantasy, not real stone age, this makes lore more flexible
* Pop is a family unit, like 50ish people
* turn is a year (or possibly a season or something)
* no pop really dies or starves
* the key mechanic is keeping tribal cohesion enough, as tribes tend to fall apart otherwise
