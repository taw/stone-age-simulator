Another idea.

Giving up on simulating people and their professions. Realistically everyone had multiple roles anyway in such small societies, and at such small scale it just causes simulation instability.

Design:
* there are tribes with technologies
* that are present in regions
* interaction of tribe stats and region stats determines how well they do
