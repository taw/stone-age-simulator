Some design notes:

* it's not 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate)
  * there's no Explore as no maps are invented
  * there's no Expand, just stay or migrate
  * there's maybe a bit of Exploit, but very limited
  * there's no Exterminate, potential conflicts are merely local
* maps don't exist - current regions, and maybe nearby and previous regions will be visible, not whole map (which might or might not exist behind the scenes)
  * maps could still be super fun to watch later
* technology is fully embedded in people
  * there's no "potato farming" technology, there could be Potato Farmer person - you need to acquire and keep such people if you want to keep the technology
  * overall technology might advance as tribes specialize and unlock new professions
  * there's no way to keep too many technologies at once
* not sure what end goal is, survival itself could be brutal
  * possibly at some tribe size and specialization it could unlock new abilities?
  * maybe some endgame to become a city state, but not sure how it would work
* there's no long term resource storage, they need to be used or lost
  * maybe some very limited storage for a few years, like for cattle etc.
* in principle every single person in the world (up to a few millions total) could be simulated (age, gender, profession, a few other such etc.), but it could be simplified
* not sure about optimal turn length - either one year and have no seasons, or have seasonal turns (3 or 12 turns a year)
* many-to-many profession to goods mapping
  * hunters can get food + clothing
  * gatherers get just food
  * etc.
  * I think there could be ~100 professions and ~50 goods eventually, but starting small to figure out the basics
* people's well-being should depend on many factors, and corresponding goods:
  * food
  * clothing
  * shelter
  * too low or too high temperature
  * stress of migration
  * stress of conflict
  * disease
* other goods modify efficiency
  * dog trainer provides dogs for hunters etc.
