Much simpler system.

* Children are not tracked, just inferred
* Food as only resource - needed 1/adult
* One profession biomes
* Different yield function

Experiments:

* 01 - every pure tribe eventually dies out due to running into biomes that don't support them
* 02 - mixed tribe is the only one that always survives
* 03 - every tribe survives if they're guaranteed some space
* 04 - mixed tribe kills everyone even if there's guaranteed biomes
* 05 - both mixed and adaptive survive; adaptive has extreme job swings
